\section{Upload helper file}
\subsection{Problem Statement}
In some lab assignments, additional helper files/code from instructor is required. A feature is required to enable this.
\subsection{Design and Implementation}
A feature was implemented to allow the instructor to upload the additional files for the assignment (only tar.gz format is supported now) which are available for the students to download while doing the assignment.

The instructor can upload a tar.gz file which contains all the required helper files while creating/modifying a lab. The file is then stored on the server as `helperfiles.tar.gz'. When a newer version of the file is uploaded, the older version will be replaced.

The link to download the helperfiles.tar.gz is located on the question paper if the file is present for the lab.
