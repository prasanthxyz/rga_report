\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item The helper file is stored on the server as `helpercode.tar.gz'. This can lead to confusion when several labs are concerned. It can be improved to have distinct names. Also, the helper file upload feature can be extended to support more formats.

\item A feature that enables downloading of all the files uploaded by the students as a single tar.gz.

\item \textbf{Show server time in question paper}: There is usually a discrepancy between the server time and the time in the computer in which student answers the exam. This leads to finishing of the deadline before/after the time expected by the student. This can be resolved by displaying the server time on the question paper.

\item A feature that enables TAs to highlight parts of students' answers while evaluation, where the answers are not editable by TAs.
