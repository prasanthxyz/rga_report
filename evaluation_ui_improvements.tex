\section{TA Evaluation UI Improvements}

\subsection{View Submissions UI}
An interface for the instructors/TAs to see all the list of submissions ordered in student groups.
A status of whether they submitted explicitly, or was timed out is shown. This helps an instructor to verify that a group had indeed submitted before they leave the hall.

\subsection{Evaluation interface}
A panel had been added with next and previous buttons for the TAs. Much improved than the previous "Search for student" interface. An colour coded index had been added to easily access particular questions, and the colour denotes the status of evaluation.

TODO: Marks to be set as zero if not answered.

\subsection{Navigation to questions}
The paned shows links to all question on the right side which can be clicked to easily navigate to that question. They also show the status of the question whether it is graded or not.
