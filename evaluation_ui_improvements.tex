\section{TA Evaluation UI Improvements}

\subsection{Evaluation interface}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A static panel has been added which contains all the navigation buttons and the the submitted files download options which are essential and frequently required during evalution by the TA's and the instructor. This panel has been optimally designed to occupy minimum space so as to not interfere with the viewability of the report as well to provide maximum usability.
\item The static panel contains next and previous buttons for the TA's. The TA's can easily navigate through all the submissions of each group using these buttons. It provides much improvements than the previous "Search for student" interface.
\item An colour coded index had been added to easily access particular questions, and the colour denotes the status of evaluation. "Green" coloured background denotes that the question has been already evaluated. "White" coloured background means that the question is yet to be evaluated.
\item Marks for those questions which are not answered as automatically set as zero, and the status is set as `evaluated' so that the TAs need not check them at all.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Jump to questions, easy navigation}
The panel shows links to all question on the right side which can be clicked to easily navigate to that question.

\subsection{Downloading submitted files}
TODO: This\\
The file submission UI was very difficult and confusing. A button is shown now to download submitted files.
