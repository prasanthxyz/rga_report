\section{File Submissions UI}

\subsection{Uploading files by students}
The file submission UI was pretty confusing. Now it is shown at a better location, plus the uploaded files are displayed to the student.

\subsection{Downloading submitted files}
The file submission UI was very difficult and confusing. A button is shown now to download submitted files easily.
