\section{File Submissions UI}

\subsection{Uploading files by students}
The interface for student file upload was confusing. The previous design had a button in the bottom saying `submit additional files' and no explicit `Finish Exam' button. This created confusion about a closure of the exam. Also, no feature was present to verify that the files were indeed uploaded.\\

Along with a Finish Exam button, a UI was implemented where the list of uploaded files are displayed along with their MD5Sum. The students can see the files uploaded and verify the integrity using the MD5Sum. Delete/Download of existing files are not allowed, but replacing a file is allowed (within the deadline) by uploading again with the same name.\\
