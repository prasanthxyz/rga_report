\section{File Submissions UI}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The interface for student file upload was incomplete. The initial design had a button in the bottom saying `submit additional files' and had no explicit `Finish Exam' button. This created confusion about a closure of the exam. Also, no feature was present to verify that the files were indeed uploaded. A feature is required to display the uploaded files where the students can verify its content.

\subsection{Design and Implementation}
Along with a Finish Exam button, a UI was implemented where the list of uploaded files are displayed along with their MD5Sum. A download feature was not provided to prevent plagiarism (sharing the file download URLs among examinees). The students can see the filenames of the uploaded files and verify their integrity using the MD5Sum. Deleting a file is not allowed, but files can be replaced (within the deadline) by uploading again with the same name.\\
