\section{Better Edit Lab/Delete Lab Interface}
\subsection{Problem Statement}
The interface for editing/deleting labs is difficult to use. A more intuitive interface is required to edit/delete labs.

\subsection{Design and Implementation}
In the report grading app interface where the labs are listed, `Edit' and `Delete' buttons were added to each lab. The front-end was changed such that the labs can be edited/deleted in place.\\
On pressing the edit button, a form appears in the place of the lab with its existing details already filled in. The instructor can easily make the changes and submit the form.\\
On pressing the delete button (only allowed for unpublished labs), a confirmation dialog is shown and the lab is deleted upon user approval.
