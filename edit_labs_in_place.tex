\section{Lab Create/Edit Interface}
The interface for editing labs was cluttery. For editing labs, the instructor had to scroll to the lab, get the lab number and other details, come to the top and add new data. This was changed to a new interface where the edit and delete buttons were added to each lab individually. In this new cleaner interface, labs can be edited in place.
