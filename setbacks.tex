\section{Issues}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Video seeking based on the time extracted from URL as we implemented does not work on Firefox as of now. Google Chrome version 41 was used for development
\item The `Discuss this section' button is populating the new discussion thread title and content by manipulating the DOM. This workaround must be avoided and done using a proper `React way', by some communication between all the components involved.
\end{enumerate}
